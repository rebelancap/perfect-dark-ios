// PDEyeTargets.mm — the eye render targets: ANGLE draws into app-owned
// MTLTextures, and the compositor pass samples them (Phase 6 M2, D-048).
//
// THE ONE THING THIS FILE EXISTS TO DO. The engine renders through ANGLE, which
// normally presents into the SDL window's CAMetalLayer. In 3D there is no
// window to present into: the picture has to end up on a quad the compositor
// draws, on the compositor's own Metal queue. So the engine's "screen" becomes
// an MTLTexture that WE own, wrapped as a GL framebuffer, and the compositor
// samples that texture.
//
// WHY THE WRAP IS SHAPED EXACTLY LIKE THIS (q2repro paid for every line —
// q2repro-ios/docs/visionos-3d-plan.md :63-110, app/Sources/immersive/xr3_glue.m
// :433-470):
//
//   * eglCreatePbufferFromClientBuffer does NOT accept EGL_METAL_TEXTURE_ANGLE
//     (its buftype switch only knows D3D and IOSurface). The route that works
//     is eglCreateImageKHR(EGL_METAL_TEXTURE_ANGLE) ->
//     glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES -> glFramebufferTexture2D.
//   * the MTLTexture must belong to ANGLE's OWN MTLDevice. On visionOS ANGLE
//     always uses MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() (its registryID selection is
//     #if TARGET_OS_OSX), and that instance is also the compositor's device —
//     so one device serves both sides. We assert it rather than assume it.
//   * depth is a RENDERBUFFER, not a texture: ANGLE-Metal refuses a separate
//     stencil renderbuffer beside a depth TEXTURE, and PD's default-framebuffer
//     path assumes depth24/stencil8 is there (gfx_sdl2 asks SDL for both).
//   * ANGLE renders into the texture on ANGLE's queue, and the compositor reads
//     it on the compositor's queue. The two have NO ordering. So each published
//     frame carries the (MTLSharedEvent, value) ANGLE signals for it, and the
//     presenting command buffer encodes a waitForEvent on them before it copies
//     anything. This cannot deadlock: the value is signalled by ANGLE's own
//     command buffer, which was already submitted when we published.
//   * the ring is 3 deep so the compositor is never sampling the texture the
//     engine is currently drawing into.
//
// M3: THE RING HOLDS PAIRS, AND THE PRODUCER IS BOUNDED. Each of the three
// slots now carries TWO textures, L and R, wrapped as two FBOs over one shared
// depth renderbuffer (the eyes are drawn strictly one after the other and each
// clears depth itself, so one buffer is correct and saves a third of the eye
// memory). pdVisionSetEye() chooses which FBO slot 0 of the backend resolves
// to, so patch 0031 needs no second case.
//
// A pair is published ONCE, at the end of eye R, and carries one
// (MTLSharedEvent, value) for both textures — they were drawn by the same
// ANGLE command stream. Publishing increments an in-flight count that the
// event's own completion listener decrements, and eye L of the next frame
// blocks while that count is above two (plan §2.6). That is the backpressure
// the D-008 consult asked for: without it a producer that outruns the
// compositor queues command buffers without bound and the footprint climbs
// until the OS intervenes.

// panel is 118.9 deg wide, wants 5073 px across, and a 2560 cap hands it
// 2560x768, which is 2.0 Mpx. Half the budget's pixels, for the widest panel on
// the row. Wider would have been BLURRIER and not slower, which is the opposite
// of what Austin was told the trade is.
//
// So the clamp is on the pixel COUNT, which is what the footprint and the fill
// rate are actually made of, and the shape is left to the panel. The default

//             the disparity is 33 px on a 2560 px eye - 1.04 deg, which the
//             headset fuses without effort. Before the clamp the same wall at
//             30 units read 402 px. The near field keeps real depth (the
//             panel is at 3.6 m and the clamp plane renders at ~1.8 m); it is
//             only the part that was never fusable that is spent.
//   G = 2.5   the viewmodel's FAR end. Strictly greater than N, and the world
//             only approaches N asymptotically, so the invariant is exact: the
//             gun is nearer than every world pixel it borders. The half-unit of
//             margin is not arbitrary - it is 8.3 px on the shipped 2560 px eye
//             (0.26 deg, about fifteen times stereoacuity, so the ordering is
//             SEEN and not merely true) and 3.9 px on the gate's pinned 1280 px
//             eye, which is what makes it MEASURABLE by a block match whose
//             resolution is one pixel. At 2.25 both of those halve and the
//             measurement stops being able to tell the two apart.
//   knee      the soft knee begins where the unclamped law would read
//             U*N*knee, i.e. at d = C/(1 + N*knee) = C/2 with knee 0.5. From
//             there the law bends smoothly (C1) into its asymptote instead of
//             breaking, so no edge of the picture carries a crease.

 *      bracket to empty — bounded at 200 ms, loud if it expires, and never
 *      freeing anything if it does (a stuck compositor must cost a setting,

 * THE EVENT COMES BACK RETAINED (+1) AND THE CALLER MUST TRANSFER IT.

 * Paid for once: handing the MTLSharedEvent back unretained segfaults inside
 * `-[MTLCommandBuffer encodeWaitForEvent:value:]`. The engine thread publishes
 * a new pair every frame, and each publish drops the previous event's last
 * reference — so the compositor thread, which acquired a frame earlier and is
 * only now encoding, is encoding against freed memory. It is a narrow window
 * and it hit within two thousand frames.
 *
 * The TEXTURE is different and is deliberately NOT retained: the ring owns all
 * three for the whole session, and the ring is only freed after the loop has
 * been stopped and waited for (pdVision3dApplyMode's exit path). So a raw
 * pointer to a ring slot cannot dangle the way a per-frame event can.
