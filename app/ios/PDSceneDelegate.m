// PDSceneDelegate.m — the UIScene lifecycle on iOS, and the graft SDL needs.
//
// WHY (D-038). /Applications/Xcode.app became Xcode 27 on 2026-09-14 and every
// build since links against the iOS 27 SDK. iOS 27 refuses to run an app that
// was linked on that SDK and has no UIApplicationSceneManifest: UIKit trips
// __UIApplicationEvaluateRuntimeIssueForNoSceneLifecycleAdoption on the
// FrontBoard scene-creation path and the process dies with EXC_BREAKPOINT
// before a single line of ours runs. Austin's phone did exactly that with the
// first round-P build, and the concurrent round-Q agent hit the same thing on
// the SIMULATOR the first time it built after the toolchain moved (D-037 §4):
// it is the LINKED SDK that is checked, not the deployment target and not the
// device, so every build of this app on this machine is affected. "The gate was
// green yesterday" stopped being evidence the moment Xcode changed underneath
// it.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a port of the app onto scenes: SDL 2.32.8 has no
// scene support whatsoever (`strings libSDL2.a` has no windowScene, no
// connectedScenes, no scene: selector at all), it owns the
// UIApplicationDelegate, and it creates its UIWindow the pre-scene way with
// -initWithFrame:.
//
// THE GRAFT IS NOT INSURANCE - it is load-bearing, and it was measured. The
// first version of this file assumed UIKit's compatibility attachment would
// keep putting SDL's window on the scene the way PDDeepLink.m had observed it
// doing before the manifest existed. It does not. With the manifest declared,
// on lane 1 (iPhone 17 Pro Max, iOS 27.0): the engine ran at a clean 60 fps
// for 4634 frames, the bridge answered, and the screen was BLACK - drawable
// 1320x2868 where 2868x1320 was expected (no scene, so no orientation), and
// touch_overlay=none. A sceneless UIWindow appears in NEITHER
// UIApplication.windows NOR any scene's windows array, so nothing in UIKit can
// find it and nothing composites it.
//
// The handle that does work is the renderer's: ANGLE built its surface from
// SDL's SDL_MetalView (app/gfx/gfx_angle_egl.mm, pdAngleGetHostView), and that
// view's -window is SDL's UIWindow whether UIKit can enumerate it or not. The
// graft runs from the scene callbacks AND from the per-frame hook (PDShell.m),
// because the scene connects long before SDL's window exists: SDL builds it
// inside videoInit(), which is inside the engine, which starts from
// postFinishLaunch.
//
// So this class does three things:
//
//  1. It exists, and is named by the manifest, so the app has adopted the
//     lifecycle and UIKit's launch-time check passes.
//  2. It grafts SDL's window onto the scene, which is what puts the game on
//     screen at all.
//  3. It catches a deep link that LAUNCHED the app. That URL arrives in the
//     scene's connection options and nowhere else, which is the one deep-link
//     case PDDeepLink.m says it cannot handle. It can now.
//
// Everything else stays where it was. The app-level lifecycle notifications
// (UIApplicationWillResignActive, DidEnterBackground, WillEnterForeground,
// WillTerminate) are still posted to a scene-based app, and pd_ios_main.m's
// pdRegisterLifecycle() still hangs the pd.ini + eeprom save and the pacer
// suspend/resume off them; the scene notifications are observed there too, as
// belt and braces, so the save fires whichever one iOS decides to post first.
//
// VISIONOS (round V, D-047). This whole file is compiled out on xrOS. There,
// SwiftUI declares the scenes (an ImmersiveSpace can only be declared by a
// SwiftUI App) and Info-visionos.plist has no UISceneConfigurations at all —
// and the class must not merely be unused but ABSENT, because UIKit persists a
// scene session's configuration name and delegate CLASS NAME across installs
// of the same bundle id. A headset that has run the Phase-5 builds will try to
// restore a session naming this class; with the class gone the lookup fails and
// UIKit falls back to the app delegate's configuration, which is SwiftUI's.
// That is the family's fix (q2repro NOTES-FROM-VKQUAKE), and a fresh simulator
// never reproduces the problem it solves. The graft itself was never
// scene-delegate work and now lives in PDShell.m; the class method below
// forwards to it.
