/**
 * How the game thread waits for the link (D-045).
 *
 * `PDPacingWaitSem` is the original: a plain `dispatch_semaphore_wait`. On the
 * MAIN thread — which is this port's game thread — that is what killed the user's
 * touch at the 60 Hz setting, because a blocked main thread is a main run loop
 * that never turns, and UIKit dispatches its queued touches from that loop.
 *
 * `PDPacingWaitRunLoop` (the default) waits by RUNNING the main run loop until
 * the link has signalled, so event dispatch is serviced for the whole of the
 * pacer's slack instead of for SDL's two microseconds.
 *
 * Kept switchable so the two can be A/B'd live on the phone in one session:
 * `pacing wait sem|runloop` on the bridge, `pacing_wait_mode` in `state` and in
 * the heartbeat.
