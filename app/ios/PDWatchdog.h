// PDWatchdog.h — the instrument for a failure that answers no sockets (D-044).
//
// Round R's wedge on Austin's phone had the game alive by `devicectl`, touch
// dead, and the :8775 bridge silent even to `help` — a command that never
// touches the engine. A bridge that cannot answer means no socket thread got
// scheduled, and everything this port can measure is read THROUGH that bridge.
// So the next answer has to be waiting in a FILE when the phone comes back on
// the cable, written by a thread that owes nothing to GCD, to the main run loop
// or to UIKit:
//
//   Documents/heartbeat.txt   once a second, whole (temp + rename): what the
//                             app thinks it is doing right now.
//   Documents/lifecycle.txt   append + fsync, one line per lifecycle event,
//                             settings commit, pacer reconfiguration or graft.
//                             This is what survives a suspension.
//   Documents/hang.txt        a symbolized backtrace of every thread, taken
//                             when the frame hook has not run for 2 s while
//                             the app believes it is foreground-active.
//
// Rules this file obeys, because the failure it chases is "nothing runs":
//   - a plain pthread, not a dispatch queue: a jammed main queue must not be
//     able to stop it;
//   - it never calls into UIKit and never dispatches to the main thread. Every
//     UIKit-shaped value it prints is a copy taken ON the main thread by
//     PDWatchdogNoteFrame() and left in a plain struct;
//   - no Objective-C and no malloc inside the hang dumper: fixed buffers,
//     write(2), and symbolization only AFTER every suspended thread has been
//     resumed (dladdr takes the dyld lock, and the thread holding it may be
//     the one we just stopped).
