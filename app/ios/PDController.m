// PDController.m — GCController first, per the family pad rules.
//
// Perfect Dark on a pad is already a solved problem inside the engine: SDL's
// game controller API drives inputReadController() (input.c:998-1040) with
// upstream's own default binds, and a pad paired to the phone arrives there as
// an SDL_GameController without this file doing anything at all. So what is
// left for the shell is the three things SDL cannot know:
//
//   1. **Nothing, for the binds** - and that is worth writing down, because the
//      family rule is "seed still-unbound binds and re-apply on connect" and
//      here it is already done: inputInit() calls inputSetDefaultKeyBinds() for
//      every controller slot (input.c:906-908) and inputParseBindString()
//      explicitly keeps those defaults for a key whose pd.ini string is empty
//      (input.c:650-655). So a fresh container and a pad paired after launch
//      both get upstream's PC bind set with no help from us. What this file
//      does is CHECK that on connect and say so in the log, rather than seed
//      blindly over something the player chose.
//   2. **Look.** PD's right stick is NOT a look axis (docs/frame-map.md): it
//      goes into the N64 pad struct for the game's control styles. Twin-stick
//      look on a modern pad therefore has to come from the same degrees seam
//      the touch layer uses, dt-normalised so the feel does not change with the
//      frame rate, anchored at 120 Hz.
//   3. **Hide the touch overlay while a pad is connected**, and bring it back
//      when the pad goes away.
//   4. **The combat roll**, which is the user's on 0.0.0.7: "on gamepad, right
//      thumbstick click does a right roll. instead, it should be double tapping
//      left joystick LEFT or RIGHT to do a roll." Both halves live here - the
//      R3 bind is taken off the roll and the double flick replaces it (D-037) -
//      but the roll ITSELF is played by PDTouchOverlay, which is where the
//      touch layer's proven frame script already is.
