# vision-validate.sh — THE GATE, visionOS side. Nothing visionOS is published
# that has not passed this.
#
#   scripts/vision-validate.sh [--udid UDID] [--xbla] [--keep] [--no-build]
#
# A sibling of scripts/sim-validate.sh rather than a flag on it, for two
# reasons: the device, the SDK, the scheme, the bridge port and the oracle
# reference all differ, and the two run CONCURRENTLY on this machine (the iOS
# lane is another session's). Everything the two share in spirit — the assert
# list, the thresholds, the shut-down-on-any-exit trap — is deliberately
# identical, and the iOS gate is left byte-for-byte alone.
#
# It fails, loudly and non-zero, on any of:
#
#   * the build failing, or the wrong build being installed;
#   * the app not reaching a frame (the bridge answers or it does not);
#   * a drawable that is not the window's points x contentsScale;
#   * a screenshot that is blank or nearly monochrome;
#   * a bridge-injected tap that does not land on the touch layer, or a
#     left-half tap that does not raise the floating stick (the PINCH path on
#     visionOS: a pinch anywhere in the left half is the stick, no halo-only
#     targets);
#   * a gamepad button that does not reach the engine's pad mask;
#   * the M-001 chicago-solo seeded replay drawing a different gfx stream from
#     the macOS clang oracle at 1280x720, or a frame that differs from the
#     oracle's by more than 1/255 on more than 6% of pixels, or by more than
#     16/255 on more than 0.02% of them or in any group over 16 pixels (D-068);
#   * a crash, an "Unknown GBI" command, or an EGL error anywhere in the log.
#

# desktop GL break differently, so isolated edge pixels flip between the wall

# no group larger than 4, max 54-100/255; 16 of iOS's 25 sit exactly on a
