# It is not a smoke test. It fails, loudly and non-zero, on any of:
#
#   * the build failing, or the wrong build being installed;
#   * the app not reaching a frame (the :8775 bridge answers or it does not);
#   * a drawable that is not the panel's native pixel count;
#   * a screenshot that is blank or nearly monochrome;
#   * a bridge-injected tap that does not land on the touch layer;
#   * the M-001 chicago-solo seeded replay drawing a different gfx stream from
#     the macOS clang oracle, or a frame that differs from the
#     oracle's by more than 1/255 on more than 6% of pixels, or by more than
#     16/255 on more than 0.02% of them or in any group over 16 pixels (D-068);
